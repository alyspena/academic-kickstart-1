abstract: Design enhancements are often added to charts, signage, and infographics to help garner attention or communicate a message. Despite concerns of design enhancements distracting from the underlying information,  prior  studies  have  contributed evidence that enhancements and even simple decorations can improve memory of visual displays. However, there is limited empirical knowledge about how the type of aesthetic enhancements influences memory, and what informational and data elements are remembered. We conducted an experiment testing chart types (line, pie, and bar), presence of color, and whether added enhancements were contextually related to the chartâ€™s data topic.  The  findings  show  relevant  enhancements did improve recall of title and thematic elements, but enhancements did not significantly affect recall of specific data values. This suggests relevant enhancements can improve memorability of some chart content, but only if design styles are chosen well to match the information. Recall of chart topics for unrelated embellishments was worse than non-enhanced charts, which suggests that enhancements can distract or interfere with memorability if the viewer does not understand a meaningful connection between informational topic and design modifications.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: In this research, we aimed to understand the effects of graphical embellishments on memorability by collecting quantitative evidence from a two part user study.
